# Week 4

Today we'll be covering the basics of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Towards the end of the lecture, you'll have the opportunity to build your own 2D simulation with Python. If you want to watch the output of your simulation using the `FuncAnimation` tool from `matplotlib`, you'll need some additional software to render your movies.

I suggest using the `ffmpeg` tool for your animations. If you use the Homebrew package manager on a Mac, you can get `ffmpeg` by entering this command in your terminal:

    > brew install ffmpeg
    
    
I haven't tested other approaches, but you might also try the following command if you aren't using Homebrew (also, start using Hombrew):

    > conda install -c anaconda ffmpeg 
    
 
_Weeee_ can't wait to see what solutions you cook up for extending our simple MD engine.
