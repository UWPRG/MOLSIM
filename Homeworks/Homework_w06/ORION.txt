The simulation gives the following error when nvt production md is run:

WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 364]:
  The bond in molecule-type Protein between atoms 5 C and 6 O has an
  estimated oscillational period of 2.3e-02 ps, which is less than 5 times
  the time step of 2.0e-02 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

This is due to the md time step being too large compared to the fastest 
molecular movement (harmonic oscillation of a carbon-oxygen bond). I think
the 5 times is a fudge factor to ensure the time step is smaller than any
single molecular motion. It's possible to fix this by reducing the time step
used in md. In this case, reducing the time step is a reasonable solution
because 2.0e-2 ps is an order of magnitude larger than what is usually
used in simulations (20 femtoseconds versus 2 femtoseconds). Another possible
solution would be to introduce additional holonomic constraints although
this might lead to significant error in force calculations.
