On grompp with nvt gives the following warning:

WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 364]:
  The bond in molecule-type Protein between atoms 5 C and 6 O has an
  estimated oscillational period of 2.3e-02 ps, which is less than 5 times
  the time step of 2.0e-02 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

This warning makes me believe that the time step is to large for certain estimated molecular
motions of the system. In the above case, the 5 C and 6 O atom could complete 5 oscillations
before a single time step. I believe that this would be an issue because in each time step 
we would be losing critical data and information about the atoms energies and positions.

To fix this, I think we should reduce the md time step. This would help with the simulation 
accuracy and understanding how the system evolves. This would come at the cost of a shorter 
total simulation time if the simulation is ran for the same wall time. That or the 
simulation would cost more resources.
