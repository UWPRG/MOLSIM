The simulation confronted an error when working on command line:
	
gmx_mpi grompp -f ./mdp_files/nvt.mdp -c nvt.gro -p topol.top

WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 364]:
  The bond in molecule-type Protein between atoms 5 C and 6 O has an
  estimated oscillational period of 2.3e-02 ps, which is less than 5 times
  the time step of 2.0e-02 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

This warning arise because the oscillation time is much smaller compared to the time step 
we set. The GROMACS need around 5 times of the time step to complete a single period of oscillation. However, in this case, the oscillation occurs four times during the simulation. 

To solve this error, we may simply modify the time step in mdp option, or we could change another force field to make the oscillation time meets our setting
