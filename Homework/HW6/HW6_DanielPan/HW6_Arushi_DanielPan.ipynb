Column 5 is the scale factor for the HCT and OBC models. The values are taken from the Tinker implementation of the HCT pairwise scaling method. This method has been modified such that the scaling factors have been adjusted to minimize differences between analytical surface areas and GB using the HCT algorithm. The scaling is further modified in that it is not applied pairwise, but on a per-atom (rather than a per-pair) basis."
