#This is a template for evaluating simple CVs in plumed
#A given CV is typically specified as follows: ACTION LABEL ARGUMENTS OPTIONS
#For this example we want to calculate the distance, which we label d1, betweem atoms 1 & 2
#Technically the order of arguments doesn't matter so long as they are included in the block

DISTANCE LABEL=d12 ATOMS=1,2

#CVs typically have options that a helpful. For instance:
#
DISTANCE LABEL=dcomp ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
#Will return the x,y,z components of the vector instead of the distance

#Here we calculate the psi torsion angle in alanine dipeptide:
TORSION LABEL=psi ATOMS=7,9,15,17

#For long blocks, they can be split across multiple lines like so
#
TORSION ...
LABEL=psi_again
ATOMS=7,9,15,17
... TORSION 

# Additionally, PLUMED has a function called MATHEVAL which lets you define your own CVs!
# Here is an example for calculating my own CV: Dennis (it is just d1 again)
#
MATHEVAL ...
ARG=dcomp.x,dcomp.y,dcomp.z #Values you are feeding into the equation
VAR=x,y,z #Variable names you are assigning your arguments for your formulat
PERIODIC=NO #If value is periodic you must specify the bounds
FUNC=(x^2+y^2+z^2)^0.5
LABEL=Dennis
... MATHEVAL

#You can specify which variables are printed out (ARG). For printing everything do ARG=* and at what frequency they are printed out STRIDE=
# In this case the Torsion angle psi_again will not be printed out.
PRINT ARG=Dennis,d12 STRIDE=1 FILE=DENNIS

#FILE is the name of the file created with the outputs
