    "* It has the lowest T RMSD when tau = 0.1.\n",
    "* P in NVT system fluctuates at about 1000 bar, and P in NPT system(tau = 0.1) fluctuates at reference pressure 1 bar.\n",
    "* As shown in T plot in NVT for differnet tau, when tau=0.1 and tau=1, they get response quickly and fluctuate at reference temperature 350K, and have RMSD around 7, whick means tau=1 and tau=0.1 are reliable. When tau=10, it gets a slower response and slightly larger RMSD about 9, but sitll fluctuate at 350K. When tau increases to 100, it takes about 300 ps to achieve 350K and even go over fluctuating at 360K,and also has a larger RMSD about 20, which means tau=100 is unreliable.\n",

    "* RMSD is  something like level of oscillations. In NVT system, T has fluctuaction between 340K and 360K, so has RMSD about 7, while P fluctuates actutely between 500K and 1500 K and has RMSD about 400.\n",
    "* tau-t is a time constant for coupling to reference temperature, so smaller the tau-t is, quicker the response is for sure. However, if tau-t is too large, the system will get a over response.(I think it will still get to reference T after a longer period of time, though it doesn't show in this homework.)"
