    "Use **PBMetaD+SPRINT** to investigate the complex reaction network of the **isobutenyl radical** and **molecular oxygen** in **PM6** using CP2K molecular dynamics software. Any discovered reactions are to be investigated further using **Gaussian 09** to quantify potential energy changes in PM6 and create a visual representation of the reaction network with potential energies at each stationary point."
