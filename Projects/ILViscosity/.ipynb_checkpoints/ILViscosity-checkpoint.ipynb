    "There has been a push to create a genome-like organization of materials knowledge to accelerate their discovery. Few publications and databases, however, have applied their efforts in the rational design of liquids and are largely restricted to involving data of crystalline solids. Liquid materials are becoming more relevant with the advent of pressing societal challenges such as renewable energy and climate change (think flow batteries, solvents for catalysis, liquid fuels, solar-thermal energy, etc.). To spearhead efforts to bring liquid/solvent design up to speed, we would like to demonstrate model training on an ionic liquid database coupled with MD to design solvents computationally in an iterative, automated approach. We will combine MD, experiment, and ML to design solvents with desired properties. In this case, we are using ionic liquids--candidates as solvents in flow batteries--to motivate the viability of this pipeline.\n",

    "Wes has created a viscosity calculation pipeline for ionic liquids. We need to run them salts through it! The objectives for this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. generate topologies for a broad range of salts for which we have experimental values of viscosity for at 350K and in the viscosity range of 0.01-0.09 pa/s. Start at ILThermo database. We already have simulations of:\n",

    "3. generate parity plot(s) of experimental viscosity versus our calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. identify patterns. Are some salts/cations/anions being calculated better than others? should we address other kinds of salts? other temperatures?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use some of the scripts Wes has provided as a starting point. Otherwise you can handle the jobs as you see fit. \n",

    "As for actual analysis, the ipython notebook maginn.ipynb will streamline the viscosity calculations for you. the Viscosity paper form [maginn's](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00351) lab will be your primary resource. Further reading in the GROMACS manual on viscosity will be helpfull as well."
