    "\n",
    "Enhanced sampling methods are necessary to overcome the high energy barriers associated with chemical reactions. Using these methods allows us to extend accesible simulation time of unbiased MD. These simulations were biased using MetaD framework<br> \n",

    "#### Well-Tempered MetaD\n",
    "Metadynamics (MetaD) is a method for probing complex free energy surfaces, by depositing a history dependent bias potential as a function of the collective variables (CV). <br> ***Well-tempered*** MetaD is a \"flavor\" ~Chris voice~ of MetaD which uses a progressively damped bias.  In well-tempered metadynamics the rate of bias deposition decreases as a function of time. In turn, this more efficiently deals with the fluctuating course of MD.  <br> \n",
