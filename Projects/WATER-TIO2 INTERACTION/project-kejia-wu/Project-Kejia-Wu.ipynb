    "Contact angles will be computed using MD simulation of 200 water molecules in the NVT ensemble at 298.15 K on TiO2 surfaces. Two different force fields will be employed. The water molecules will be initially placed in a cylindrical configuration. The dimensions of the surfaces are ~5×5 nm2 to allow spreading of water molecules and avoid interactions with periodic images. The total simulation time are 3 ns, of which the first 1 ns serves for equilibration and the last 2 ns are used to collect data. The obtained trajectories of superficial water will be visualized using the VMD graphical interface and superimposed to obtain a statistically averaged geometry of the water droplets formed. Contact angles will be graphically analyzed from rendered images."
